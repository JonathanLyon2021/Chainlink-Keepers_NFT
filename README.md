# Chainlink-Keepers_NFT
This is a hack-a-thon project specifically for NFT minting for Chainlink in August 2022.

I chose to do this project about minting NFT's using a truffle box(react) and using Chainlink's data feeds to retrive assest prices and using VRF (Verifiable Random
Function), which is a proveable fair and verifiable random number generator that enables smart contracts to access random values without compromising security 
or usability. The best part about this project though is implementing Chainlink's Keepers and managing an UpKeep for the NFT's on-chain. Thank you for viewing my repository!
