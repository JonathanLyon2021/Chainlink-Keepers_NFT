# Chainlink-Keepers_NFT
This is a hack-a-thon project specifically for Chainlink on minting NFT(Non-Fungible Token) in August 2022.

I chose to do this project about minting NFT's using a truffle box(react) and using Chainlink's data feeds to retrive assest prices and using 
VRF (Verifiable Random Function), which is a proveable fair and verifiable random number generator that enables smart contracts to access 
random values without compromising security or usability. This project is a combination of truffle, solidity, openzeppelin, and React.js ,
but the best part about this project though is implementing Chainlink's Keepers program which allows you to use Event triggered or Time 
triggered funnctions on your smart contract. Also being able on manage an UpKeep for the NFT's on-chain through the keepers implementation 
so we can choose a NFT triggering event using the functions to active different parts of the NFT. 
UPDATE: I did not finish this hack-a-thon on time so I will be updating this repo in the future once I am finished with Module 4 @ Kingsland.
Thank you for viewing my repositiory.
